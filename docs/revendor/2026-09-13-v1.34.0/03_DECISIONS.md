# 03 — Decisions

This run was **non-interactive**. The orchestrator's brief (re-vendor v1.34.0 on
`chore/2026-09-12-libka0s-1.33.0`, then adopt `profilesPage`) stood in for the interview.

| Candidate | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Slash 10 whole-value string rows | **taken on the copy**, plus one pin | Class A. A test pins `window.name` set through the slash with more than one word, stored whole. |
| Options 18 / OptionsCompose 5 tooltip | **taken on the copy** | Class A: the descriptor already supplies `resetProfile`. |
| Kit 19 `OnProfileReset` without a key | **taken on the copy** | Class A: the harness's own AceDB wrapper already passes none, so nothing moves. |
| B1 `profilesPage = true` | **accepted** | `options-ui-§12`'s SHOULD; one descriptor line. Its own commit, with a test that was red before. |

Nothing was declined. No issue was filed, and none is owed.
